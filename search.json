      "content"  : "My personal, short sports historyThe sport was always a central part of my life, I used to do athletics and play soccer in high school. At university, sports became less important, less focused, so I usually ran, or rode the bike at most twice a week, or so, but not even close to a planned regularity. When I turned ~28, running found me again, trained 5 times a week at an amateur level, and participated in a lot of races.Some medals acquired between 2017 and 2019My best official half marathon time was 1:37:45.Covid situationAfter I lost a lot of weight in December 2019 due to hospital reasons (not covid), my primary focus was to build some muscles (and fat) back. After half a year, I was back at my normal weight, but unfortunately I couldn’t stop there. Covid didn’t push me to move more, to put it mildly, and while eating and staying at home continued, proper opposite pole, exercising couldn’t be part of my daily routine.Weight changes in last 12 months (X: months, Y: kg)I am not satisfied, not only with my increased paunch but my cardio and general physical strength either.What are my goals?Very simple: improve fitness, make sports daily routine again, and participate in the WizzAir Budapest running race on 29th August 2021 (10k or 21k distance, doesn’t really matter, frequent exercising is the only mandatory expectation).Plan to deliverFirst and foremost: change starts right now. I pulled my Polar v800 watch from the bottom of the drawer, charged it, changed the battery in the H10 HR sensor, and put the training plan together with Polar Flow. Optionally I may complete exercises with Freeletics workouts, which I really like, and have experience in it with more than 1100 training in my muscles.First month of HR based training planWish me luck and fortitude! Follow and join me on Strava, if you want, and achieve results together!Progress so farLater I plan to summarize my weekly progress below.Week #1Trainings were easy and introductory. My HR rised so fast, therefore during low-HR jogging I had to walk a lot. My body needs to get used to sports again, but I’m glad first week’s over, waiting for next steps curiously.Week #2Getting better, but received second Pfizer-vaccine, which knocked me out, so I had to skip Sunday training. I am almost pretty sure, that Monday will be skipped, too, due to the very same reason. :(Week #3Monday was skipped as mentioned. We were on holiday at the whole week, travelled to the lake Balaton, but trained almost every single day, and on Saturday I had the opportunity to go for a fantastic bike ride. My weight did not change so far, so I have to focus on my candy consumption as well. :)Week #4An eventful week with extra biking and hiking activitied compared to the plan. I enjoyed it!Week #5Average week with the enjoyment of Saturday chill with a training-free day. Planned to go to hike, but rain stopped and made us to watch European Football Championship. :)Week #6I keep going, nothing special!"

      "content"  : "Several independent sources declare, and if we are honest, no reason to contradict, that the last 2 decades were one of the happiest, most peaceful period in human history. Hardly had any wars compared to previous centuries globally, many diseases could be cured or prevented, had food and water to consume, even in the poorest countries things got better. I can recommend a swedish doctor, Hans Rosling, UN health-specialist’s research and fact quizzes in this topic. He highlights, that things got better during past couple decades even in developing countries, not only in the “west”, and related to this, even most intellectual people have a confused, more than 30 years old picture of the world – quite shocking to realize.So we started 2019 in this social situation without any “training” before, when a little virus could turn our whole,  previously known world upside down, and made us prove, that humans are still able to adapt to environmental circumstances. Right now it seems, that science was able to provide solution, but to make it complete, every single person needs to contribute.Preliminary stepsIn Hungary a governmental, very quickly fillable form is the only official option to register for vaccine. These collected data are transferred to your GP (your “personal”, local doctor), who hopefully knows everything about your medical history, and also able to decide, which vaccine is good for you. At this point, you have no chance to cherrypick between vaccine types.It was the end of January, when I applied for, and almost 3 months later, yesterday received the first dose. I think it is quite good considering, that I am 33 with no serious diseases, and I declined the first vaccine from another company 3-4 weeks ago. Why did I do this?Quick health historyThe answer is pretty straightforward: a little more than 1 year ago, I had got hospitalized for more than 3 weeks with a simple Campylobacter bacterial infection’s side effect: Guillain-Barre syndrome, which is an autoimmunish disease with (in most cases temporary) paralysis. I have the most wonderful GP of all, who really cares about patients, and considering circumstances, so I was put into another vaccine’s waiting line. One day I answered the phone, and accepted the proposed vaccine planned for the weekend.ExpectationsI hoped as fast process as possible in the vaccination center, no people in my 2-meter radius. Expected so much waiting in different lines, justifiably frustrated healthcare workers and generally impatient people. What happened really?RealityMy appointment for vaccination was at 11:30, Saturday, but arrived much earlier, because I wouldn’t want to make a whole country wait. Pushed the front door of the hospital, a soldier immediately stopped me: disinfection time! Some fluid onto my hands, some questions about health, yes, everything is okay. Next room was a big hall, separated logically: you need to register at left side, soldiers checked your data with appropriate respect and some humour to encourage lightly frightened people. In the middle of the hall, at another desk, two people in white jackets double-checked my health condition (without measurements or any technical device), and tell me where to wait. After a short period, a nice nurse / doctor asked me to go behind the blue curtain with her, and while her colleague checked my address, where vaccination cards can be sent to, I got the vaccine in my chosen arm (left). I double-checked, which vaccine it was. After leaving the separated premise in the middle, I was asked to wait for my first certificate at the right, where three girls edited these papers with all data, most importantly with the date and time of my next dose of vaccine. After like 15 minutes, a soldier shouted my name gently (I know gently shouting may sound weird, but it happened), and handed my papers over with reading some lines (for checking purpose) loudly, such as my name, mother’s name, birthdate and next vaccination time.SummaryThe whole process is well-organized, every people knows his or her job, health workers are extremely nice despite the tremendous work, and even soldiers can be funny in a good way, while keeping order. I appreciated all the help and hard work these people have beeing doing for the whole country for more than a year, and now I am even more grateful. For the second vaccination I definitely plan to carry some goods (chocolate, bonbon, etc.) for thanking them – it’s not much, but can be a gesture of being valued. They all deserve the highest appreciation and respect."

I can easily suggest this class to anyone, who is interested in Python, generally in programming or game developing.Teachers from Rice University playing Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-SpockYou can see my homework codes on GitHub, feel free to try the games I coded, especially this one, which is kind of an Asteroid game coded in Python (sprites are not my work, those were provided by instructors, and I was grateful for that, because I wouldn’t draw such good effects). Press the little play button on the upper left corner. It is best in Google Chrome, have fun!IT Business Analysis – be a bridge between business and devsI’ve been Head of IT BA team for two months or so, and this transition period is very interesting and exciting in my life. In the last couple years I worked as a frontend engineer with strong technical focus, then some years as head of that team, but this is one is quite different: we need to understand business demands, have to translate into IT “language”, e.g. into a system or application design, which can developers can work from, and most importantly: deliver stuff in the end. I am not ashamed to learn from others, so beside case studies and own experiments, I also get information from traditional courses and instructors. This is why I tried to pick a training especially from someone, who is not near to our own organization, never saw our working process, and can teach me out-of-the box BA concepts. NorwalkAberdeen seemed to match these requirements with Fundamentals of Business Analysts.Understanding the business benefitsEven though the course is very short (couple hours of video with some homework and note taking exercises to understand and point out important things in a mass), it covers the most relevant elements of BA interviewing, requirement analysis, stakeholder and lifecycle management, agile, waterfall, SDLC, transforming needs, UML stuff (E-R, data flow, use-case, bpm), etc. with a deepdive opportunities, links for every topics. Rabbitholes are endless.It’s definitely worth these really minimal invested hours!"

These are weekly, sometimes bi-weekly allocated, very interesting tasks, which you are able to understand the topic and get hands-on experience with.Cryptography is an indispensable tool for protecting information in computer systems. In this course you will learn the inner workings of cryptographic systems and how to correctly use them in real-world applications. The course begins with a detailed discussion of how two parties who have a shared secret key can communicate securely when a powerful adversary eavesdrops and tampers with traffic. We will examine many deployed protocols and analyze mistakes in existing systems. The second half of the course discusses public-key techniques that let two parties generate a shared secret key. Throughout the course participants will be exposed to many exciting open problems in the field and work on fun (optional) programming projects. In a second course (Crypto II) we will cover more advanced cryptographic tasks such as zero-knowledge, privacy mechanisms, and other forms of encryption. /Course summary on Coursera/I expected an average quality from a free online course, something like 4 of 10, and also believed, that Stanford is a 10 of 10 in being great (engineering) school. I was curious, how these two seemingly opposite prejudices met, and the answer is here: extremely wonderfully. I had to fight with every assignments, not much, but enough, enjoyed all of them, never were boring. I won’t lie to you: there were slides, which I had to check twice, while I was learning. Okay, maybe four times, sometimes six. My point is, it’s not a course, which you run through, and may also require to have some preliminary study in mathematics (nothing more than a solid high school knowledge) and analytic skills.State of AccomplismhentI can encourage you to take this class with good hearth, if you already accepted that writing a crypto library is not a senior developer-only thingie, but more like a complex mathematician task, and you want to understand deeply, why."

      "content"  : "Last year’s ending was quite exciting at work, because in the mid of December one of government’s organizations (I do not name it for purpose) changed an SSL certification – we did the same with the pair of it, of course -, but the connection was still not working. No other modification was communicated, so we tried to figure out what happened at our side.  The penalty of late data provision would have been ~1.700 USD / customer, and 10.000+ of them were affected, so you can imagine how hard we tried to solve the situation.I want you to be in context: there was serious chance getting a penalty for this incident, because of a deadline which we must provide information before. Because of the communication error we couldn’t send these files and the penalty could be 8-9 digits in HUF. (No other official workaround exists.)Firstly, we imported ssl certs to local Windows keystore and tried to call remote webservice with a tunnel, which was working, so we realised, that ssl certs are fine and besides them there must be other changes in the system. We could not communicate with the government organization, not getting email answers and did not have direct contact either unfortunately. (Later, when things got really hot, we tried to call their IVR system and pushed buttons randomly, but in the end, nobody was competent in this problem enough.)We thought about keystore problem, because we do not use the official and recommended JBoss keystore for this cert, but an own one for many reasons I do not explain here. We made some test, nothing suspicious, so moved on.Photo by Silas Köhler on UnsplashIn JBoss server.log UntrustedURLConnectionIOException appeared (I won’t copy the whole stacktrace). After googling a bit we have found this Apache Jira ticket, which explained us what the problem may be. After checking remote webserver it turned out it is an IIS. We use a JBoss Application Server 6.1 with CXF right now, so the environmental details and JBoss stacktrace were the same as it is described here. I copy the explanation from Jira:Problem is that client certificate verification is done by IIS in later time, not at the beginning of the SSL communication. I’ll try do describe the communication:1. SSL Handshake is done between client and IIS server, but first WITHOUT client certificate verification.2. Client sends the HTTP request (at least the header, where URL is specified).3. IIS server recognizes the requested URL and re-initiates the SSL handshake (with SSL message Change_cipher_spec). It works in this way because in IIS you can specify different SSL behaviour for different URLs. So for example, for one endpoint you can configure SSL without client certificate and for second endpoint WITH client certificate.4. During the second SSL handshake, the client certificate is requested by IIS server and verified.5. Then the rest of request is processed by IIS server.We took a deep breath, okay, guys, this is a known error, let’s solve it. What is the workaround? None. Maybe a CXF update, maybe not, but Christmas was close, so there were not any chance for doing this with tons of INT, UAT testing, etc. At this point we had external developers on site as well to help and build literally dozens of variations of SSL parametrization in the business application. Remember once more, we were not told that besides ssl cert change, there were other modifications! This is why we focused on our side and tried to do everything we could.Also checked the RFC of:7.4.4. Certificate RequestWhen this message will be sent:A non-anonymous server can optionally request a certificate from the client, if appropriate for the selected cipher suite. This message, if sent, will immediately follow the ServerKeyExchange message (if it is sent; otherwise, this message follows the server’s Certificate message).It was strange, nothing helped. This was the point where we asked our official JBoss support about core CXF implementation. After giving all information we had they agreed we checked everything we could so they rebuilt cxf-rt-ws-security*.jar with security modification you see explained in Jira ticket linked above, and after second try it just worked. Penalty is off the table. Huh.Many days later governmental organization replied, and after some e-ping-pong they admitted they changed IIS SSL settings. After reverting that, the official JBoss CXF implementation worked as well.End of story. Unfortunately, I am not allowed to publish our temporary code manipulation and solution of CXF security classes here, but I am pretty sure, Jakub will create an official workaround here."

Now I am really glad about the decision I’ve made. By the way, I simply cannot understand, how Apple can call his watch a sportwatch, if it does not contain gps sensor inside.Photo by EngadgetThe new features of Polar will come in 3 months, so knowing Polar’s communication, it will come by May.

I simulated the distribution for big numbers, because my mind was so against it, and it worked well (not my mind, of course it did, too, but the code). Paradoxon of Monty Hall is kind of the same type of mindblowing problems with extremely easy math."

The reason is on the second picture: visibility is not as accurate in the second option as the first, so you always tear more papers, than you think you do based on your eyes’ perception.Okay, this was kind of a funny post only, but being green and decrease, later completely avoid unnecessary usage of recources is key to save our environment."

      "content"  : "Since I started working in CIB, some of my friends asked me about Giro account number systems: can we fill account numbers incorrectly in internetbank, is it possible to transfer money, where we don’t want to, because of a typo? Short answer is no, or very unlikely. But why?GIRO account numbers formatStart from a quick and not so accurate definition: card numbers are what are printed on debit or credit cards, while account numbers identify banking accounts. These two connect in banking systems, when card gets assigned to particular account. This can be changed very easily, but traditional banks are not offering such online services usually. Giro account numbers contain 2x8 or 3x8 numbers, and the 8-digits blocks are separated by hyphen (-). In Hungary most banks introduced the 24-digit format, but the biggest competitor (OTP) is a commited 16-digit user. Frankly, it doesn’t really matter, filling last 8 digits with zeros can transform type-16 to type-24.So the format is the following: AAABBBBC – DDDDDDDE – FFFFFFFG.What can we know from each digits?Let’s check one by one, what numbers mean or how are generated.AAA: Giro-code from 3 digits, in Hungary, MNB (Central Bank of Hungary) provides it and assigns to banks. (e.g. CIB – 107, OTP – 117, etc.) The actual list can be downloaded from MNB homepage.BBBB: Branch identifier of the bank.C: A checksum generated from AAABBBB, the exact algorythm will be described later.The specification says that remaining 16 digits can be used for customer identification, but most banks do this with 9-16 digits, and last 8 numbers are used for sub-accounts, ot not used at all, as we saw previously. A common best-practice is:DDDDDDD – Customer internal, bank-specific ID.E – Generated checksum from DDDDDDD.FFFFFFF – Sub-account ID.G – Generated checksum from FFFFFFF.Error detectionBased on the previously mentioned 3 generated checksums, transfer services or basically anybody can check, if the account numbers you are trying to transfer money to, is valid or not logically. Obviously it doesn’t validate it’s real existence, but can avoid unwanted transactions.Photo by Anna GruThe error detection algorythm is the following:Multiply first 8 digits’…  first number by 9  second number by 7  third number by 3  fourth number by 1  fifth number by 9  sixth number by 7  seventh number by 3  eighth number by 1,and add these products. The summarized amount must be divisible by ten without remainder. If it’s not, the giro account number cannot be valid.As a consequence, most likely there won’t be mistaken transfers, as long as you don’t have multiple errors in the same account numbers. So no reason to worry, but always handle your finances with proper care."

In Hungary, the newest scam is about the following: you receive a phone call from unknown number about possible winning of 6 million HUF (roughly 20.000 EUR), if you read out a freshly bought prepaid phone card’s number over the phone. That mentioned plastic item costs maybe like 3.000 or 5.000 HUF, and even if I got cheated – thinks the victim – it’s not much compared to the opportunity to change my life (“bigger good” as John Stuart Mill would say) and push millions into my pocket.  It’s an obvious fraud from an external point of view, and you immediately recognize it, but when you are in, maybe it’s not that trivial.I believe, that options to earning money legally and planned, if you have none at the moment, is quite limited: you work hard, or you have an idea, and after you work hard. People tend to forget about St. Benedict’s regula’s most important teaching: ora et labora. We as humans usually do not pray and work, but pray (optionally), and hope to get lucky."
